<p>Ink.Inc is a project focused on the interaction of tattoo artists and their clients, where you can either sign up as an tattoo artist or a normal user trying to find your next tattoo! Our web application makes it possible that the artists share their portfolio as well their avaible flash tattoos, so the users can easily find what they want in the search page using our category and tag system. Moreover, we've implemented a private chat system so artists and clients can exchange information or even schedule their next tattoo.</p>
